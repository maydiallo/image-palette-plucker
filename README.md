# Description
My program allows you to get all the colours from an image. The RGB value as well as colour is displayed this information can then be used to your liking. Alternatively if you want to make it grayscale this can be done as well. 

## How it works 
- With the colour retrieval the image selected is first cropped 
- This reduces the amount of pixels and makes getting all the colours easier 
- The colours are then displayed in groups of 6 
- Each time the user clicks on the button it generates the next 6 colours 
- The colours are displayed in descending order
